### I have completed the tutorial for ros and tried to do the first assignment.
Following are the advancements I made:
* Understood what is to be done in the first question and tried to write a code to generate a numpy array for the checkerboad.
* In part 2, I tried to get the image stored in disk and publish it.

Following could be the reasons because of which I failed in completeing the task:-
* The code is new to me and I'm finding it difficult to write the code for the task.
* On googling the problem, the number of varied solns are confusing and each one tries to implement a new soln, and as a beginner it's difficult to understand how that soln could solve my problem
* In last 1 week , I got discouraged of not making sufficient progress even after giving much time.
* Also, there have been recent involvements in acads due to many quizzes scheduled this week, and thus didn't focus much on the task.

Time spent:- 20-30 hours
